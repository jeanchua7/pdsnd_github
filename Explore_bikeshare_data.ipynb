    "From the scatterplot, we can observe that the peak periods for New York tends to be between 8:00 to 10:00, and 17:00 to 19:00, which corresponds to the times that people generally go to work / return home. Looking at the density of the dots, we can see that these are usually trips that take less than 25 minutes. We can charge based on 15-minute intervals or less, which would then allow people to return the bikes within this time frame, thereby allowing for more people to use the bike within this 2-hour period.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Chicago, on the other hand, the peak period tends to be over a shorter window; mostly 7:00 to 8:00 (1 hour) and 17:00. The corresponding trip durations, when compared to New York, also indicates that the trips tend to be shorter than 25 minutes. Simimlarly, we can come up with lower pricing for the off peak periods, such as before 07:00, between 09:00 and 15:00, and after 19:00.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the average trip duration, we can see that it is relatively consistent throughout the day for New York as compared to Chicago, where there are more spikes for certain periods e.g. 1100, 1400. In addition, the average trip duration does not exceed 25 minutes. This allows us to understand user behaviors better in terms of how long they will usually need a bike for, and we can tailor our pricing to provide added value  e.g. instead of charging based on 60 in intervals, we may want to charge by 30 minute intervals to encourage users who may not have previously rented bikes because they feel that they are overpaying for the rental."
